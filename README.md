# Rent-A-Car Database Initialization

This repository contains a T-SQL query designed for use in future personal projects. The query creates an initial simple database related to a car rental service. This database has been designed as an OLTP database and has been normalized.

## Key Features

- **Database Name**: `RentACar`
- **Schema**: `general`
- **Normalization**: Data normalization has been performed with four main tables initially (Rent, Employee, Client, and Car) and then further normalized.
- **Data Validation**: Constraints have been added to ensure data integrity, including foreign keys, unique values, and check constraints.
